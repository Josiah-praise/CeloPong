# Note 71: Tokenomics Considerations

## Summary
If the game launches a token, we need tokenomics guidelines.

## Implementation Notes
- Define total supply, emission schedule, and how rewards convert into tokens.
- Allocate a portion for player incentives, team, treasury, and partnerships; document cliffs/vesting.
- Implement anti-dump mechanics (claim cooldowns, staking) to keep value stable.
- Align in-game sinks (entry fees, cosmetic purchases) with token utility.

## Observability
- Track token distribution analytics (holders, transfers) using blockchain explorers or custom ETL.
- Monitor reward claim rates vs total emission to adjust incentives.

## Next Steps
- Engage legal counsel regarding securities regulations before launching.
- Build community feedback loops for token governance proposals.
