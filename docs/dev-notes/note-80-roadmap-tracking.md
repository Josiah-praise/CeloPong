# Note 80: Roadmap Tracking

## Summary
A transparent roadmap keeps the team aligned. Document tooling and processes for roadmap management.

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain a single source of truth (Linear, Notion, GitHub Projects) with statuses (idea, planned, in progress, shipped).
- Tie roadmap items to GitHub issues/PRs and link back to relevant developer notes for context.
- Review roadmap monthly with stakeholders and update priorities based on community feedback and metrics.
- Keep a changelog summarizing roadmap adjustments to provide historical context.

## Observability
- Track delivery accuracy (features shipped vs planned) and lead time metrics.
- Use retro templates after each milestone to capture wins/gaps.

## Next Steps
- Publish a sanitized public roadmap to keep community members informed.
- Align roadmap tags with analytics dashboards to understand impact after delivery.
